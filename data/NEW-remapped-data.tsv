Christopher John Farley of Time stated that "The beats are fresh and involving, and Dr's collaborations with Eminem and Snoop Dogg have ferocity and wit." Although he was ambivalent towards the album's subject matter and guest rappers, Greg Tate of Spin was pleasantly surprised by "the most memorable MC'ing on this album com from Dr himself, Eminem notwithstanding" and stated, "Whatever one's opinion of the sexual politics and gun lust of Dr's canon, his ongoing commitment to formal excellence and sonic innovation in this art form may one day earn him a place next to George Clinton, if not Stevie Wonder, Duke Ellington, or Miles Davis."	5	1

Kane lay in a joke: at a party in 1986, Tambala was asked how he and Ayuli knew each other; he lied that the two played together in a band, going on to describe their sound as "a bit Velvet Underground, a bit Cocteau Twins, a bit Miles Davis, a bit Joni Mitchell." A week later, the two were contacted to record a demo on the strength of Tambala's fabrication.	2	2

258	Atlantis_Quartet	Atlantis Quartet	musicians	408		musicians			2006	style and reception	9	On Atlantis Quartet's debut album, Again, Too Soon, All About Jazz reported that they "create an aura of musical textures that sound as fresh and relevant as they did in Miles Davis' heyday" and while "they're all talented songwriters, attacking their compositions with utmost earnestness...they sound as if they're just having fun." In a review of their second album, Animal Progress, JazzTimes critic Bill Milkowski called the Atlantis Quartet "modern jazz renegades" who "shift nimbly from a punk-jazz aesthetic to ECM-ish sensitivity." Regarding the same album, City Pages writer Rick Mason described "a signature Atlantis sound that taps historic elements like swing, bop, and free jazz while referencing contemporary bits of funk, rock, and world music, then rolls it all into a cohesive bundle of kinetic energy with the visceral allure of intense fireworks and the intellectual challenge of multilayered complexity." Of their fourth album, Expansion, MPR's David Cazares wrote that they "deliver rapid-fire licks in complex rhythms and changing tempos, much like the best jazz-rock ensembles of the 1970s."	4	0

He remarked that its "murkier, funkier vibe" draws on the "hypnotic funk" of early 1970s albums such as Miles Davis's On the Corner (1972), Herbie Hancock's Sextant (1973), and Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971).	15	4

(edit) In the 1960’s, concerned that the counterculture had pre-empted the discourse on drugs to the detriment of labor productivity stateside, conformity by youth to middle class morals, their motivation to work and succeed and particularly the fighting morale of U.S. troops in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, the federal government carved out of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) a brand-new, specialized entity, the National Institute on Drg Abuse (NIDA), which has since become the source of funding for 80% percent of drug research undertaken worldwide.	2	0

In a review of their second album, Animal Progress, JazzTimes critic Bill Milkowski called the Atlantis Quartet "modern jazz renegades" who "shift nimbly from a punk-jazz aesthetic to ECM-ish sensitivity." Regarding the same album, City Pages writer Rick Mason described "a signature Atlantis sound that taps historic elements like swing, bop, and free jazz while referencing contemporary bits of funk, rock, and world music, then rolls it all into a cohesive bundle of kinetic energy with the visceral allure of intense fireworks and the intellectual challenge of multilayered complexity." Of their fourth album, Expansion, MPR's David Cazares wrote that they "deliver rapid-fire licks in complex rhythms and changing tempos, much like the best jazz-rock ensembles of the 1970s."	4	0

"One the world's most powerful wine critics" — the writer obviously forgot the "of" (and the other references for that matter, originally in Italian, my second language, "James Suckling è il grand connoisseur del mondo del vino" -Gentleman magazine and "quello che oggi è considerato il più influente giudice del mercato vitivinicolo mondiale" -Sommelier Toscana) is much closer to my version of this information: influential is the closest synonym there is to powerful and the rest of the reference is exactly the same to the current phrase.	1	0

"For him, color is a means for distinguishing images that overlap and combine," the late artist and former Chicago Sun-Times art critic Harold Haydon said in 1974. "Figures and faces smiling, grimacing, static and moving, in complex compositions great and small." Sanford became particularly popular in the 1960’s for his ink drawings like those of Frederick Douglass, Duke Ellington, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Albert Einstein, Buddy Rich, and Miles Davis.	1	0

3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	first paragraph	0	Alongside Miles Davis's electric bands, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever, and Headhunters, Weather Report is considered to be one of the pre-eminent early jazz fusion bands.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	musical style	10	Initially, the band's music featured a free, extended improvisational method (similar to Miles Davis's Bitches Brew-period work), but by the mid-1970s this had moved towards more groove-oriented and pre-structured music (as epitomized by their hit single "Birdland").	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	musical style	13	Wayne Shorter came to the group with a reputation as a dominant role as an instrumentalist, drawn from both his solo work and his contributions to Miles Davis’ "second great quintet" during the 1960s.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	history	18	Zawinul went on to play with Cannonball Adderley's group in the 1960s, while Shorter joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and then, in 1964, Miles Davis' second great quintet.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	history	19	Zawinul would later join Shorter in contributing to the initial fusion music recordings of Miles Davis, and both men were part of the studio groups, which recorded the key Davis albums In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	history	19	In consequence, Weather Report has often been seen as a spin-off from the Miles Davis bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s, although Zawinul was never part of Davis's touring line-up.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	history	20	Zawinul and Shorter recruited another Miles Davis associate, the classically trained Czech-born bass player Miroslav Vitouš, who'd previously played with Zawinul as well as with Herbie Mann, Bob Brookmeyer, Stan Getz and Chick Corea (Vitous has subsequently claimed that it was in fact Shorter and himself that founded Weather Report, with Shorter bringing in Zawinul afterwards.) All three men composed, and would form the core of the project.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	history	20	During recording, Alias quarreled with Zawinul (allegedly due to Zawinul being too dictatorial over the percussion approach) and the innovative Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira (yet another Miles Davis alumnus) was brought in to complete the record.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	history	22	It built on the avant-garde experiments which Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew, including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement.	49	124	
3789	Weather_Report	Weather Report	musicians	113046		musicians			1970	releases since the bands breakup	89	The nearest that the band ever came to reuniting was, when Zawinul and Shorter both played live with Miles Davis on July 10, 1991 in Paris (the only time when Zawinul is known to have shared a live stage with Davis).	49	124
