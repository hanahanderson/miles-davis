Weather_Report	Weather Report			4	1496	Alongside Miles Davis's electric bands, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever, and Headhunters, Weather Report is considered to be one of the pre-eminent early jazz fusion bands.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	Musical style		10	2774	Initially, the band's music featured a free, extended improvisational method (similar to Miles Davis's Bitches Brew-period work), but by the mid-1970s this had moved towards more groove-oriented and pre-structured music (as epitomized by their hit single "Birdland").
Weather_Report	Weather Report	Musical style		13	4788	Wayne Shorter came to the group with a reputation as a dominant role as an instrumentalist, drawn from both his solo work and his contributions to Miles Davis’ "second great quintet" during the 1960s.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	History		18	7147	Zawinul went on to play with Cannonball Adderley's group in the 1960s, while Shorter joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and then, in 1964, Miles Davis' second great quintet.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	History		19	7542	Zawinul would later join Shorter in contributing to the initial fusion music recordings of Miles Davis, and both men were part of the studio groups, which recorded the key Davis albums In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).
Weather_Report	Weather Report	History		19	7542	In consequence, Weather Report has often been seen as a spin-off from the Miles Davis bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s, although Zawinul was never part of Davis's touring line-up.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	History		20	8181	Zawinul and Shorter recruited another Miles Davis associate, the classically trained Czech-born bass player Miroslav Vitouš, who'd previously played with Zawinul as well as with Herbie Mann, Bob Brookmeyer, Stan Getz and Chick Corea (Vitous has subsequently claimed that it was in fact Shorter and himself that founded Weather Report, with Shorter bringing in Zawinul afterwards.) All three men composed, and would form the core of the project.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	History		20	8181	During recording, Alias quarreled with Zawinul (allegedly due to Zawinul being too dictatorial over the percussion approach) and the innovative Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira (yet another Miles Davis alumnus) was brought in to complete the record.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	History		22	9323	It built on the avant-garde experiments which Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on Bitches Brew, including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement.
Weather_Report	Weather Report	Releases since the band's breakup	Lineups	89	40808	The nearest that the band ever came to reuniting was, when Zawinul and Shorter both played live with Miles Davis on July 10, 1991 in Paris (the only time when Zawinul is known to have shared a live stage with Davis).

You could call it subliminal, but the horn line is based on Miles Davis' "So What." I wrote that on the bus between New York and Cincinnati.

User_talk:Murgh/Archive_4	User talk:Murgh/Archive 4	James Suckling	On a related note ...	472	124999	I have changed "counted among the world's most influential..." back to "regarded as one of the world's most influential..." since firstly it seems editors on wikipedia prefer this phrase e.g. Mostafa Amin, Albert Einstein, Mao Zedong, Milan, Akhil Reed Amar, Miles Davis etc and because secondly, this phrase is more accurately representative of the given sources which back up this claim. "One the world's most powerful wine critics" — the writer obviously forgot the "of" (and the other references for that matter, originally in Italian, my second language, "James Suckling è il grand connoisseur del mondo del vino" -Gentleman magazine and "quello che oggi è considerato il più influente giudice del mercato vitivinicolo mondiale" -Sommelier Toscana) is much closer to my version of this information: influential is the closest synonym there is to powerful and the rest of the reference is exactly the same to the current phrase.

Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Entertainment/2011_May_8	Wikipedia:Reference desk/Archives/Entertainment/2011 May 8	Name of jazz song		23	3379	It is NOT one of the songs on Kind of Blue, but I would check into songs from Miles Davis done between 1950-1960 or so (i.e. when he was still doing "cool jazz" and before he got heavy into the Jazz Fusion stuff like Bitches Brew).

Describing his performance on tenor sax, writer John Kelman said that Walden was "as thoughtful yet fiery a player on the bigger horn as he is on alto" and called his 2009 release Momentum "a document of one of the modern mainstream's most provocative saxophonists, composers, and bandleaders," favorably comparing Walden's composition "Like a Flower Seeking the Sun" to Wayne Shorter's title track from Miles Davis's album Nefertiti.

To_Pimp_a_Butterfly	To Pimp a Butterfly	Music and lyrics		18	10332	Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly described the album as "embracing the entire history of black American music." Dan Weiss of Spin noted "shades of Miles Davis' On the Corner and free jazz all over , as well as Sly Stone’s There's a Riot Goin' On and Funkadelic and Erykah Badu's similarly wah-crazy but comparatively lo-fi New Amerykah (4th World War)," but stated nonetheless that "the sense of this album is vividly contemporary." Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune also noted the album's affinities with previous black music, but argued that "Lamar takes familiar musical tropes into new territory." The Atlantic noted the influence of collaborator Flying Lotus, writing that "his signature sound—jazz instrumentation and hip-hop layered into chaotic collages—is all over the album." Steve Mallon of The Quietus noted an "eerily warped psychedelia bursting out of its idiosyncratic arrangements."

User:Sunspot_Soldier/sandbox	User:Sunspot Soldier/sandbox	Style and reception		9	2251	On Atlantis Quartet's debut album, Again, Too Soon, All About Jazz reported that they "create an aura of musical textures that sound as fresh and relevant as they did in Miles Davis' heyday" and while "they're all talented songwriters, attacking their compositions with utmost earnestness...they sound as if they're just having fun." In a review of their second album, Animal Progress, JazzTimes critic Bill Milkowski called the Atlantis Quartet "modern jazz renegades" who "shift nimbly from a punk-jazz aesthetic to ECM-ish sensitivity." Regarding the same album, City Pages writer Rick Mason described "a signature Atlantis sound that taps historic elements like swing, bop, and free jazz while referencing contemporary bits of funk, rock, and world music, then rolls it all into a cohesive bundle of kinetic energy with the visceral allure of intense fireworks and the intellectual challenge of multilayered complexity." Of their fourth album, Expansion, MPR's David Cazares wrote that they "deliver rapid-fire licks in complex rhythms and changing tempos, much like the best jazz-rock ensembles of the 1970s."
