        [ 'User:Remurmur today added a line stating that in addition to the album\'s title, the cover color scheme of Sketches of Japan is an intentional reference to the "red/yellow theme" of Miles Davis\' Sketches of Spain album cover.',
          'The same argument could be made for the implied title reference as well (citation is needed) - although in the case of the title, it seems much more likely to me (and to "the average reader"?) that the choice of "Sketches of..." for a jazz album title in this case is more than coincidence and was likely made with full knowledge of the (intentional) similarity to the Miles Davis\' album title.' ] } ] }
