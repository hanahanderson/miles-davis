       quote: [ 'My mom used to take me to see classical concerts", says Blackman. "My dad was into jazz â€“ Miles Davis, Ahmad Jamal, people like that." Blackman\'s first introduction to the drums happened when she was seven years old in her hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio and attending a pool party at a friend\'s house, she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set. "It was incredible", says Blackman. "Just looking at them struck something in my core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them", says Blackman. "And then, when I hit them, it was like, wow, that\'s me.' ] } ] }
