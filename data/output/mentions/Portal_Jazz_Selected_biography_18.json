       quote: [ 'One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time (some would say the best), Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up copying Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead, and it was not until Jon Faddis\'s emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy\'s style was successfully recreated  Arguably Gillespie is remembered, by both critics and fans alike, as one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time."' ] } ] }
