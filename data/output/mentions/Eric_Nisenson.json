        [ 'Nisenson became a lifelong lover of jazz at the age of 15, when he listened to trumpeter Miles Davis\'s 1959 album Kind of Blue.',
          'By the time Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis was published in 1982, however, the friendship had ended (Davis was not easy to get along with, though Nisenson wrote in a second revision of the biography, that Miles had deserted him as Cicely Tyson was determined for Miles to start a new lifestyle and cut his ties with the past).' ] } ] }
