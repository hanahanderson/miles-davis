       quote: [ 'With variations of the Miles Davis composition "All Blues" interweaving through the work, the play reimagines the story of Ray Sprigle, a white reporter from the Pittsburgh Gazette who, in 1948, traveled through the Jim Crow South posing as a black man and recorded his life-changing experiences in a series of articles entitled "I Was a Negro in the South for Thirty Days." Price\'s most recent play is Red Devil Moon, a musical written with composer Pam Ortiz based on excerpts from Cane by Jean Toomer.' ] } ] }
