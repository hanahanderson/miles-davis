       quote: [ 'In 1981, after he returned from Ghana and before making On Land, Robert Quine played him Miles Davis\' 1974 track "He Loved Him Madly", a melancholy tribute to Duke Ellington influenced by both African music and Karlheinz Stockhausen: as Eno stated in the liner notes for On Land, "Teo Macero\'s revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the "spacious" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini\'s 1973 film Amarcord, it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently."' ] } ] }
