       quote: [ 'Between the influence of Laswell and Buckethead, Praxis\' musical experimentation in both studio, street and live settings have combined elements of mid-70’s Funkadelic & Miles Davis, hip-hop’s more avant-garde leanings, and Last Exit\'s ferocious yet organic jazz/metal aesthetic.' ] } ] }
