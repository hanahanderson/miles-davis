       quote: [ 'While Good\'s lyrics on Lights remain socio-political and personal in nature, the album marks a departure from Good\'s rock-driven style with layered arrangements and instrumentation featuring horns, strings, woodwinds and piano â€“ a reflection of Good\'s musical upbringing and tastes, listening to big bands from Glenn Miller to Basie, as well as modern jazz, such as Miles Davis and Mingus.' ] } ] }
