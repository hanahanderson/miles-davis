       quote: [ 'Around age 11, after receiving musical recommendations from a cousin and attending the Newport Jazz Festival, he quickly became a self-declared "jazz snob". "I lost interest in rock \'n\' roll and started developing an anti-social personality." Fagen regularly took the bus to Manhattan to see Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis perform.' ] } ] }
