        [ 'Masqualero (named after a Wayne Shorter composition originally recorded by Miles Davis) recorded several albums for ECM Records, and Molvær recorded with other ECM artists before his 1997 debut solo album, Khmer.',
          'Molvær\'s muted trumpet sound, sometimes electronically processed, had an obvious debt to Miles Davis\'s work of the 1970s and 1980s, but without being a slavish copy.' ] } ] }
