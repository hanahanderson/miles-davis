Hendrix wasn\'t also an actor, businessman, or known for his high-profile public persona or relationships (Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Lennon, et al.) There is a section about his death in the article (accessable through the TOC) with a note about a separate Death of Jimi Hendrix article.' ] } ] }
