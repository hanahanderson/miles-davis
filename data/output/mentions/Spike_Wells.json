       quote: [ 'He took up playing drums in his early teens: "I suppose the thing that really knocked me out about jazz was the rhythm, so I thought if I\'m going to be in a jazz band I want to be the drummer." He later had lessons from former Miles Davis drummer Philly Joe Jones, who lived in London in 1967â€“9, and Wells was also very influenced by another of Davis\'s drummers, Tony Williams.' ] } ] }
