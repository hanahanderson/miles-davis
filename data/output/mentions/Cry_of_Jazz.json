        [ 'In contrast to the claim made in The Cry of Jazz that "jazz is dead", 1959 is widely considered a landmark year of innovation in jazz due to the release of four groundbreaking albums: Kind of Blue by Miles Davis, Time Out by The Dave Brubeck Quartet, Mingus Ah Um by Charles Mingus, and The Shape of Jazz to Come by Ornette Coleman.',
          'With Kind of Blue, Miles Davis established a previously developing style of jazz, called modal jazz, which uses fewer chords and melodic improvisation based on scales.' ] } ] }
