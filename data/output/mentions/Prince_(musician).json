       quote: [ 'Critic Simon Reynolds called him a "pop polymath, flitting between funkadelia, acid rock, deep soul, schmaltzâ€”often within the same song," writing that "Prince doesn\'t so much build bridges between categories as create music that exceeds each category simultaneously." Prince has been compared with jazz great Miles Davis in regard to the artistic changes throughout his career.' ] } ] }
