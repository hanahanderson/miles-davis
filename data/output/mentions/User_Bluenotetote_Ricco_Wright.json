       quote: [ 'This aspect of his life would soon take on a life of its own, as Wright became quite the music lover in a sense that he was once primarily a fan of hip hop, R&B and gospel, and was quickly becoming an avid listener of The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis, among many other artists spanning the past six decades.' ] } ] }
