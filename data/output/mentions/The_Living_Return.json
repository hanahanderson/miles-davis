       quote: [ 'New Musical Express magazine gave The Living Return an 8 out of 10 rating in its17 September 1994 issue, saying that the album "...sounds divine, a glissando of strings and things, an aural bath for the ears." Q magazine also spoke favourably of the album, mentioning that "SOS have an ear for a snappy arrangements and a mature lightness of touch as they gently echo Miles Davis, Weather Report and the whole modish Afro era." It rated the album with four stars and an "excellent" rating.' ] } ] }
