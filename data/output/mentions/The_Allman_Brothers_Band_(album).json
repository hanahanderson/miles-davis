        [ 'Trucks introduced Johnson to the Grateful Dead and the Rolling Stones; Johnson likewise introduced the group to jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane, and Betts did the same with country music and Chuck Berry.',
          'Duane Allman had previously listened to Davis and Coltrane before Johnson\'s suggestion, and his two favorite songs — Coltrane\'s version of "My Favorite Things" and Miles Davis\' "All Blues" — were the basis for the majority of the band\'s modal jamming, "without a lot of chord changes."' ] } ] }
