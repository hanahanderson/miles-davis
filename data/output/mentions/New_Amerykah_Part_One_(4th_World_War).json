       quote: [ 'Sputnikmusic\'s Nick Butler said the album "moved beyond the ideas and conventions that have defined neo-soul over the past decade." Greg Kot wrote that, "Like her peers D\'Angelo (with Voodoo in 2000), Common (Electric Circus in 2002) and the Roots (Phrenology in 2002), Badu has made a record that defies efforts to categorize it." He remarked that its "murkier, funkier vibe" draws on the "hypnotic funk" of early 1970s albums such as Miles Davis\'s On the Corner (1972), Herbie Hancock\'s Sextant (1973), and Sly & the Family Stone\'s There\'s a Riot Goin\' On (1971).' ] } ] }
