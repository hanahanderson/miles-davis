       quote: [ 'As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music â€“ " guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" -and postwar cinema: " Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the \'70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on.' ] } ] }
