   { 'dbo:abstract': [ { value: 'Music Choice (abbreviated as MC) is an American company that programs music and produces music-related content for digital cable television, mobile phone and cable modem users in the United States. Music Choice programs dozens of audio music channels for digital cable subscribers, as well as programs and produces music-related content for on-demand customers with access to Music Choice On-Demand. Music Choice also offers video and audio music programming for cell phone customers through Sprint and AT&T. Music Choice\'s interactive music video network, SWRV, was started in February 2010 and rebranded in 2013 to Music Choice Play.Many digital cable and telco companies carry Music Choice, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter Communications, Cablevision, Cox Communications, Verizon FiOS, AT&T U-verse, Grande Communications, Service Electric Cable TV, CenturyLink, and Bright House Networks. Other companies offer similar audio services for commercial customers, such as Muzak, DMX and Galaxie.The following is a list of all of the music streaming channels that exist from Music Choice, an American company that programs music and produces music-related content for digital cable television, mobile phone and cable modem users in the United States. Music Choice (formerly known as Digital Cable Radio) was the first digital audio broadcast service in the world and, under its founder and CEO David Del Beccaro, launched in test markets circa 1987.As of 2014, Music Choice offers 53 linear channels: one video channel, Music Choice Play, 46 and 4 new audio-with-slideshow channels, and one audio-only channel named Taste of Italy; the first and last are only available in a few limited areas.  For cable customers with digital-cable-ready tuners, all Music Choice channels may be available as digital subchannels on a single physical TV channel of around 40Mb/s if the cable provider transmits them in clear QAM.  This is because the "slideshow" for each music channel runs at a very low frame rate, allowing for the compression ratio to be very high for the MPEG-2 digital video compression used in the ATSC standard.The channels on Music Choice does not include interruptions.  All of Music Choice\'s audio music channels provide continuous music streaming with no talk, commercials or bumpers. Music Choice offers various streams across multiple genres, with each devoted to a particular genre. While a song is playing, artist, song and album or mixtape information appears on screen as well as trivia facts, artist pictures and generic graphics relevant to that particular channel. It also changes old artist photos to new photos. Music Choice has an editorial staff that checks facts and finds images to provide for artists. Music Choice programmers select the music based on current charts, music trends, sales, what they feel is hot in the industry and feedback from viewers. All of Music Choice\'s channels are clean version except for six: Rap, Metal, Alternative, Rock Hits, Dance/EDM and Adult Alternative.After each song, the screen design will rotate to prevent burn-in on television screens. Banner advertisements are displayed on every music channel in lieu of commercials, programmed by individual providers at the headend level via local insertion. Music Choice does not offer any spoken word programming; an unrelated service, the CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks, provides a complementary slate of talk radio channels to cable providers. Music Choice has been found as of 2013 to be the fourth highest-ranking channel in Nielsen ratings based in the 12-34-year-old demographic. (en)' } ],
