   { 'dbo:abstract': [ { value: 'The Cellar Door was a music club at 34th and M Street NW in Washington, D.C. from 1965 through 1981. It emerged from The Shadows, Georgetown, Washington, D.C. It was one of the premier music spots in Washington and was the genesis as well as a tryout for larger markets. Many artists cut their professional teeth performing at the Cellar Door, while audiences delighted in being within a few feet of the stage at the tiny venue. Many notables in 1960s and 1970s music played there. Some of the performances at The Cellar Door were recorded and released. The club was the venue for the renowned Live-Evil (later expanded into The Cellar Door Sessions), a live album with Miles Davis. Richie Havens recorded most of the tracks on "Richie Havens Live at the Cellar Door" there in 1970 and The Seldom Scene, a Bethesda, MD based bluegrass band, recorded their signature live album "Seldom Scene Recorded Live At the Cellar Door" in December 1974. Danny Gatton\'s The Redneck Jazz Explosion album was also recorded at The Cellar Door.Some of the names that played there during their careers were:Artful DodgerJackson BrowneBrewer and ShipleyJimmy BuffettJJ CaleGeorge CarlinHarry ChapinLarry CoryellBill Cosby (warm-up comic for the Mitchell Trio with John Denver)The Country GentlemenJim CroceMiles Davis (whose concerts there were the basis for the critically acclaimed Live-Evil, later expanded into a box set comprising the entire unedited performances "The Cellar Door Sessions")John Denver (He wrote and sang his "Leaving on a Jet Plane" there prior to being released by Peter, Paul and Mary.)Fat City (later to become the Starland Vocal Band)Doc and Merle WatsonJohn FaheyThe Newgrass RevivalPaul SiebelSteve GoodmanGreat Speckled Bird (Ian & Sylvia)Happy The ManRichie HavensRick NelsonPete KennedyB.B.

Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert (as Fat City) opened for John Denver in December 1970.  Late one night, Denver helped finish writing a song that Danoff and Nivert had started. They debuted "Take Me Home, Country Roads" on December 30, 1970.In a January 31, 1981 Washington Post newspaper article, Richard Harrington  wrote that the Georgetown club which helped promote the careers such stars as Linda Ronstadt,  James Taylor,  John Denver, Richard Pryor, Neil Young and Jackson Browne, was sold the previous day for an undisclosed sum to Paul Kurtz and Howard Bomstein from Washington, D.C. Ultimately, the club was closed down by the DC fire marshal after numerous warnings. It had been licensed for 163 seats, but was found to have more than 200 people SRO at times. Also, the books for liquor sales were allegedly being done improperly, so instead of making money, a fair amount of money was being lost, unbeknownst to the club owners. (en)' } ],
